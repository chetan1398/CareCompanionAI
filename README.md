# üè• CareCompanionAI


## About
This project is the final submission for the course Prompt Engineering INFO7375 at Northeastern University, conducted under the guidance of Professor Nick Brown. The project showcases the practical application of advanced prompt engineering techniques, LLMs, and generative AI to solve real-world problems in the healthcare domain.

**CareCompanionAI** is a healthcare-focused, AI-powered chatbot designed to assist users with intelligent responses to questions about hospital systems, physicians, patient reviews, payer coverage, and visit data. It uses advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques over structured (Neo4j) and unstructured (review) data to generate accurate and context-aware responses.

This project is ideal for hospitals, clinics, and healthcare administrators looking to provide quick, reliable answers about their operations to patients, staff, or management via natural language interfaces.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

In the real world, healthcare systems store complex data about hospitals, doctors, reviews, visits, insurance coverage, and more. Accessing this data intelligently in natural language is difficult.

**CareCompanionAI bridges this gap** by:
- Structuring the healthcare domain into a graph.
- Enabling natural language access to both structured (Neo4j) and unstructured (reviews) data.
- Generating accurate responses using OpenAI‚Äôs latest LLMs.

### Key Features and Functionalities

-   **Intelligent Query Resolution:** The chatbot can efficiently answer complex queries related to hospital management, including information on physicians, patient records, hospital reviews, and visit history, leveraging Neo4j's graph database.
-   **Custom Cypher Queries:** Users can ask detailed questions requiring specific Cypher queries, with the chatbot dynamically generating these queries based on the context.
-   **Context-Aware Conversations:** The chatbot maintains context across interactions, ensuring coherent and relevant responses throughout a conversation.
-   **Data-Driven Insights:** The system provides data-driven recommendations and insights, helping hospital administrators make informed decisions.

### Challenges Faced and How They Were Overcome

-   **Neo4j Integration:** Integrating Neo4j with the LLM presented challenges, particularly in ensuring accurate Cypher query generation. This was addressed by iterative prompt engineering and model fine-tuning, improving the chatbot's ability to generate precise queries.
-   **Maintaining Context:** Ensuring the chatbot retained context over extended interactions was challenging. This was mitigated by incorporating ConversationBufferMemory, which helped maintain continuity in dialogues.
-   **Fine-Tuning for Specificity:** Tailoring the LLM to the hospital domain required fine-tuning with domain-specific data. The challenge of obtaining relevant data was overcome by creating custom datasets, which significantly enhanced the model's relevance and accuracy.


### Fine Tuning
1. **Fine-Tuning Process:** The fine-tuning process was crucial in enhancing the chatbot's performance. Below are the key steps and considerations taken:
2. **Data Collection:** Gathered diverse and representative question-answer pairs related to hospital management. The dataset was stored in a JSON file (fine_tuning_data.json) containing prompts and corresponding responses.
3. **Training Data Preparation:** Converted the raw data into a format suitable for fine-tuning, with prompt and completion keys.
4. **Prompt Engineering:** Developed a specific prompt template emphasizing the chatbot's role as a hospital management assistant.The template ensured that responses were contextually relevant and accurate.
5. **Model Selection:** Utilized the text-davinci-003 model from OpenAI for fine-tuning, chosen for its balance of performance and efficiency.
6. **Iterative Fine-Tuning:** Ran multiple iterations of fine-tuning with the prepared dataset.
Each iteration was reviewed to ensure improvements in response accuracy and relevance.
7. **Memory Integration:** Incorporated ConversationBufferMemory to maintain context across interactions, enhancing the conversational experience.
8. **Testing and Validation:** Post fine-tuning, the model was rigorously tested with new queries to validate its performance.Adjustments were made based on testing feedback to optimize the final model.
9. **Deployment:** The fine-tuned model was integrated into the chatbot's architecture, improving its response quality and user experience.
